# Guerilla Marketing Concepts: "The Mystery ARG"

Strategy: Generate viral curiosity and "TikTok sleuthing" through fictional mystery and "glitch in the matrix" storytelling.

## 1. The "Time Traveler" Lost & Found
*   **The Hook**: Post physical "LOST ITEM" flyers around high-traffic areas in Seattle.
*   **The Twist**: They look normal from a distance, but the details are impossible/futuristic.
    *   *Headline*: "LOST: Prototype Unit 04"
    *   *Date*: "Last seen: November 2028"
    *   *Material description*: "Non-Newtonian Fabric / Liquid Chrome"
*   **The Funnel**: The flyers have a phone number. Calling it plays a "static/glitch" voicemail. Texting it sends a link to a hidden, password-protected "Drop Page" on the website.

## 2. "System Failure" Stickers
*   **The Hook**: Place industrial-looking, high-quality stickers on everyday objects (mirrors in bars, park benches, lamp posts).
*   **The Detail**: Text reads **"REALITY RENDERING ERROR: DO NOT TOUCH"** or **"TEXTURE NOT FOUND"**.
*   **The Funnel**: A QR code that leads to a web-AR experience (using the site) where the object appears to "melt" or "re-title" itself, revealing a discount code or an exclusive pre-order link.

## 3. The "Retitled" Landmarks
*   **The Hook**: Digital/Physical takeover of local geography.
*   **Concept**:
    *   *Physical*: Use chalk or temporary (non-destructive) tape to "Re-Title" street signs or landmarks for a photo op. (e.g., "Pike Place" becomes "RETITLED MARKET").
    *   *Digital*: Run a social campaign where users "Retitle" their own environments/outfits using a branded filter/template.
*   **The Funnel**: Creates a sense of a "secret society" or underground movement involved in rewriting the city.
