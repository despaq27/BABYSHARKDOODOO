# Project Blueprint: RETITLED

## 1. Brand Identity
**Name**: **RETITLED**
**Concept**: Re-naming, re-defining, and re-claiming fashion. "Retitle your look."
**Vibe**: **"Editorial Industrial"**
*   **Aesthetic**: Raw but polished. Think exposed code, typewriter fonts (Courier/Mono), strikethrough text effects, and high-contrast visuals.
*   **Color Palette**: Off-Black (`#111111`), Paper White (`#F5F5F5`), "Error" Red (Accent), and Safety Orange (Highlights).
*   **Psychology**: It sounds established, exclusive, and intellectual. It fits the "Fluid" narrative perfectly—you are rewriting the title of who the clothing is for.

## 2. Distinguishing Features (The "Wow" Factor)

### A. The "Re-Fit" Switch (Formerly 'Boyfriend Switch')
*   **Description**: A toggle on every product page labeled **[Standard] / [Retitled]**.
*   **Interaction**: Flipping the switch triggers a liquid morph transition.
    *   *[Standard]* shows the item fit to size (traditional femme styling).
    *   *[Retitled]* shows the *same* item oversized, layered, or styled on a different body type/gender presentation.
*   **Tech**: React state controlling Framer Motion `layoutId` transitions.

### B. "The Index" (Visual Search)
*   **Description**: A chaotic, masonry-style "mood board" that replaces the homepage.
*   **Interaction**: Users don't search for "Pants". They click on *textures* (Concrete, Silk, Rain). The grid reshuffles instantly to match that mood.
*   **Tech**: Client-side filtering with heavy use of `animate-shared-layout`.

### C. "Motion-First" Grid
*   **Description**: No static images on the PLP (Product Listing Page).
*   **Interaction**: Every grid item is a 9:16 video loop. Hovering enters "Scrub Mode" where moving the mouse Left/Right scrubs through the video timeline to check fabric movement.

## 3. Marketing Strategy: "Rewrite the Narrative"

### Go-to-Market Strategy: "Visual Storytelling"
*   **Campaign**: **"Title: Untitled"**
    *   Launch teaser showing models ripping labels off clothes and stamping "RETITLED" over them.
*   **Content Pillars**:
    1.  **Behind the Seams**: Raw, unedited footage of the design process. Highlighting the "Ultra High Quality".
    2.  **The Fluid Test**: Side-by-side videos of the same item on a 5'2" femme model and a 6'1" mascot/male model. Caption: "Fits everyone. Titles irrelevant."

### "Fluid Fashion" Angle
*   Market the clothing not as "Unisex" (which sounds boring/shapeless) but as **"Universal Structure"**.
*   Use "Architecture" terminology instead of fashion terms (e.g., "Structural fit" vs "Baggy").

## 4. Technical Architecture

### The Stack (Modern & High-Performance)
*   **Framework**: [Next.js 14 (App Router)](https://nextjs.org/) - For SEO and React Server Components.
*   **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For rapid, custom design implementation.
*   **Animations**: [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - Critical for the "liquid" transitions.
*   **Backend/DB**: [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) - PostgreSQL database for inventory and auth.
*   **Image/Video**: [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) or Vercel Blob - For optimizing the heavy video content.
*   **State**: [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) - Distinct from Redux, simpler for UI state.

### Phase 1: MVP (Landing Page + Product Demo)
We will build the **Landing Page** with the "Index" feature and **One Product Detail Page** demonstrating the "Re-Fit" switch.

**Status**: Awaiting User Approval to Initialize Codebase.
