# Hype-Stream Infinite Scroll Implementation Plan

## Goal Description
Implement a TikTok-style "vertical deck" infinite scroll shopping experience. This feature, "Scroll to Shop," will serve as a high-engagement interface blending product discovery (Type A), brand vibe (Type B), and visual art (Type C). It focuses on gesture-based interactions (swipe to cart, double-tap to heart) and gamification to increase user dwell time.

## User Review Required
- **Dependencies**: I plan to use `framer-motion` (already in package.json) for all animations. If complex gestures (like hold-to-pause vs tap) become tricky, I might need to add `react-use-gesture`, but I'll start without it.
- **Assets**: I will use placeholder images/videos unless specific assets are provided. The plan assumes "mock" content for now.

## Proposed Changes

### New Components

#### [NEW] [page.tsx](file:///c:/Users/desmond/Desktop/retitle/src/app/scroll-to-shop/page.tsx)
- The main entry point for the "Scroll to Shop" feature.
- Sets up the full-screen layout and hides typical navigation elements if necessary for immersion.

#### [NEW] [HypeFeed.tsx](file:///c:/Users/desmond/Desktop/retitle/src/components/feed/HypeFeed.tsx)
- The core container managing the vertical snap mechanics.
- Handles the "virtual" stack of cards to ensure performance (only rendering current, prev, next).
- Manages global feed state (active index).

#### [NEW] [FeedCard.tsx](file:///c:/Users/desmond/Desktop/retitle/src/components/feed/FeedCard.tsx)
- A polymorphic component that renders the specific card type based on data.
- Handles common gestures:
    - **Swipe Right**: Add to cart.
    - **Double Tap**: Wishlist/Heart.
    - **Long Press**: Quick Look overlay.

#### [NEW] [ProductCard.tsx](file:///c:/Users/desmond/Desktop/retitle/src/components/feed/cards/ProductCard.tsx)
- Type A content: Looping video of product, pricing overlay, "Shop Now" subtle CTA.

#### [NEW] [VibeCard.tsx](file:///c:/Users/desmond/Desktop/retitle/src/components/feed/cards/VibeCard.tsx)
- Type B content: UGC style, grainy filters, focus on aesthetic/social proof.

#### [NEW] [TripCard.tsx](file:///c:/Users/desmond/Desktop/retitle/src/components/feed/cards/TripCard.tsx)
- Type C content: AI art/abstract visuals.
- Might include the "Remix" button logic here.

#### [NEW] [FeedStore.ts](file:///c:/Users/desmond/Desktop/retitle/src/store/feedStore.ts)
- Zustand store to manage:
    - `currentIndex`: Which card is active.
    - `wishlist`: Array of liked item IDs.
    - `cart`: Array of cart item IDs.
    - `isMuted`: Audio state.

### Modified Files
- None expected to be heavily modified, as this is a new standalone page, but I might lightly touch `globals.css` if global scroll behavior needs tweaking for this specific route.

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
1.  **Route Navigation**: Verify accessing `/scroll-to-shop` loads the full-screen interface.
2.  **Scroll Interaction**:
    - Scroll down -> Snaps to next card.
    - Scroll up -> Snaps to previous card.
    - Verify infinite illusion (looping data or sufficiently long list).
3.  **Gestures**:
    - **Swipe Right**: Verify "Added to Cart" toast/vibration feedback (visual).
    - **Double Tap**: Verify Heart animation appears and item is added to wishlist state.
    - **Long Press**: Verify video pauses and "Quick Look" details appear.
4.  **Content Variety**:
    - Scroll through at least 10 items to verify the pattern (A, B, C mix) appears correct.
5.  **Responsiveness**:
    - Test mobile view (chrome dev tools) to ensure touch targets are thumb-friendly.
